# Biscuit for GTK

Made using Oomox/Themix. Requires the Papirus Icon Pack for the icons to work.

### Usage
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/tsukki9696/biscuit.git
```
Create the necessary folders to store the icons if they don't exist
```sh
cd
mkdir .icons .themes
cp -r ~/biscuit/ports/gtk/biscuit-dark biscuit-light ~/.themes
cp -r ~/biscuit/ports/gtk/papirus-biscuit-light papirus-biscuit-light ~/.icons
```

You can then set the GTK and icon theme using Lxappearance.
